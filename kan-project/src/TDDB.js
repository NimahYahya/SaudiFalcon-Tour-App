      "body": `The Masmak Palace is a tourists’ favorite and a must-visit destination in the capital city of Saudi Arabia.
       Not only do Saudis and expatriates appreciate the majesty of this vast architectural wonder, but it draws interest 
       from across the world as well. However, while we all know about the Masmak Palace and most of us have paid a visit 
       to it at least once, we often overlook the secrets this monument has in store for us. So, here are some facts that
       you probably did not know about the Masmak Palace that glorifies the streets of Riyadh. In fact, in the heart of Riyadh’s 
       old quarters, Masmak Fort is a magnificent citadel that takes us back to the history of Saudi Arabia. This is the fort 
       stormed by the late King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1902, creating a turning point in the history of the Arabian peninsula. 
       You can still see his spearhead embedded in its wooden gate. Today, Masmak Palace is an acute and virtually official symbol 
       of the pivotal rise of the Saudi nation. An episode dramatically recreated in a short film that plays in Masmak’s museum tells 
       the historic story even today. Amid its halls and rooms displaying photographs, weapons and armor, there is a plaque commemorating
       Saudi Arabia’s national day that refers to the late King Abdul Aziz. The Masmak Fort popularly known as Qasr Al-Masmak stands today 
       as a testament to the late King Abdul Aziz’s bravery that led to the reunification of Saudi Arabia.` ,

      "body": `Mada’in Saleh, not far from al-Ula (22 km), was known as al-Hijr, or Hegra, by the Nabataean people who carved
       its magnificent tombs into the golden Quweira sandstone outcrops. The delicate details on the entrance portals and the 
       smooth surfaces of its 111 tomb façades reflect the great skills of the masons of their time. The splendor of the natural
       setting here must have reminded the Nabataeans of their capital, Petra, hewn into the rosey sandstone cliffs to the north 
       in modern-day Jordan. It is no wonder that they chose this very spot to build their second city, Hegra. Based on the many 
       dated tomb inscriptions, Hegra thrived between 1 BCE -74 CE. The Nabataeans began as pastoral nomads, raising their sheep, goats,
       and camels in the desert as so many other Arabian tribes have done through the millennia.`,

      "body": `The picturesque city of Abha is located in the fertile mountainous region of Asir in the southwestern part of the Kingdom.
       Here clouds seem to sit on top of the mountains for most of the year. Abha can, therefore, rightly be called a ‘capital of clouds’
       where their meeting with the delightful and charming places increased the city’s beauty coupled with the cool air that the region enjoys 
       throughout the year. Situated at high altitude of 2,270 meters above the sea level, the city enjoys pleasant weather all year round.
       Abha’s mild climate, natural beauty, historical, social and cultural heritage, its unique agricultural environment, and its particular
       brand of festivals has earned it the title of Arab Tourism Capital a few years ago. The Asir region houses more than 4,275 heritage villages,
       including Rijal Alma, which is expected to be registered in the World Heritage List of UNESCO. Rijal Alma is one of the Kingdom’s most prominent 
       cultural and archaeological destinations and is considered an architectural icon. Asir is also renowned for its stunning scenery such as the woods 
       and forests in Dulghan and Al-Habala, in addition to the spectacular scenery of Al-Sawdah, which has the highest mountains in the Kingdom, 
       including the tallest peak.`,

       has determined the opening hours of the center between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Red Sea Mall has been keen on
       following all procedures and preventive measures while allowing visitors. The body temperature is measured for 
       each new comer at the entrances of the mall, in addition to requiring employees and visitors alike to wear masks
       and gloves during their presence inside the mall and sterilizing their hands at the entrance. The mall has deployed
       various hand sanitizers throughout the center.`,

      "body": `First of all, in a country where the stereotype landscape is an endless extent
       of sand dunes, Jizan is all about tall green mountains, deep blue sea, virgin islands, 
       and pristine beaches. Jizan and Al-Bahah, the two smallest provinces in Saudi Arabia, 
       are also the only two ones where no desert sand dunes can be found. Instead, Jizan 
       Province has only low white sand dunes along its shore. Then, in a country whose climate 
       is so arid that despite its vast territory has no permanent river reaching the sea, Jizan
        Province benefits from the monsoon which gives two rainy seasons annually where most of 
        the country has barely one. Thanks to these special climatic conditions and its geography,
        Jizan Province hosts green wadis, like the famous Wadi Lajab, and also several hot springs,
        like Bani Malik and Al-Khoubah, that are reputed for their therapeutic qualities. It is 
        also famous for its high-quality production of tropical fruits like mango, figs, and papaya.`,

      too, with daytime temperatures averaging in the low 20s Celsius during the day and around 10 degrees at night. The region also has a growing
      reputation as an arts, sports and entertainment destination. It is home to the kingdom’s first street-art exhibition, in Al Khobar’s Bayoonya 
      district, and offers a range of cultural hubs and museums as well. Dip into science and innovation at SCITECH, or get your fill of pop culture at
      the quirky Taybeen and Alfelwah and Aljowharah museums. As evening falls, wander the walkways of Dammam's Share Al Hob souq, where you may encounter
      traders, performers and street musicians.`,

          Guinness World Records declared Al Ahsa the largest self-contained oasis in the world. What that means for travelers is that there’s
          plenty to choose from. From hot and cold springs to historic mosques to sweeping panoramic vistas, you’ll find a lot to explore in this
          6,000-year-old oasis, which has long been a gateway to the Arabian Peninsula for travelers from the East. Don’t miss a chance to sample a

      late winter. The city’s heart is still intact in Al Balad, the magical historical quarter that has undergone a renaissance in recent years. And the Red
      Sea is still central to it all — for trade, for diving among pristine reefs, and for fishing for Jeddah’s legendary seafood. The city where Eve was laid

           are mild and dry, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 32 C, making it comfortable to stroll

          in the city in the 1970s, that are dotted along the waterfront. For many, coming here is about watching 
          the sun set over the Red Sea then seeing the launch of the 300-meter King Fahd’s Fountain, the world’s tallest,
          with its great jet of water lit up until midnight and visible across the city year-round.`,

      rugs and goat-hair tent covers. Visitors flock to Tabuk to explore ancient archaeological sites and the setting of the
      story of the prophet Moses, who lived east of the city for a decade. Marking the start of the Saudi Coast, Tabuk’s charming 
      coastal towns, such as Haql and Sharma, offer clear seas and pristine beaches. But there are more terrains to explore: Consider 
      checking out the carved tombs of Maghaer Shuaib in the desert, or the Moses Springs near Maqna, where natural springs flow under
      date palms. Or the stunning Tayeb Al Ism, a valley of steep granite stones separated from the turquoise-fringed Gulf of Aqaba by only
      the road.`,
